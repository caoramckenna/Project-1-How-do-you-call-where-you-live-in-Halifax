# Project - How do you call where you live in Halifax
Practicing pandas, geocodio, map box, datawrapper and adobe Illustrator


The 00-project1-workfile.ipynb is where I practiced cleaning data with pandas and geocoding addresses. 

GeoObs.json is the geojson file I took from python into datawrapper. 
index.html is the code for the web page, made with a scrollytelling story template provided by Jonathan Soma. 
map_points.csv, map_points_2.csv and map_points_no_blanks.csv are versions of the cleaned data put into a .csv file. 
coloured_points.qgz is the file I brought from mapbox into illustrator, but went back to Datawrapper to do what I wanted. 
data-jun-27.csv is the data from the Google form spreadsheet 
image-map-files holds the Adobe Illustrator files for the images I used. But I will admit I had to use preview to crop one of them because I couldn't figure it out and I gave up trying. 

In Datawrapper I didn't like that I had to delete my point's name and put it as a tooltip -- I feel I should have been able to toggle the text from title to tooltip somehow. 

If you want to contribute where you live and how you call it to this map you can fill out the Google Form https://forms.gle/gZ93Gu17SAbipJhT9 and I may or may not add it someday.
